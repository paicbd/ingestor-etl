# Ingestor ETL ‚Äì Open Source Version

**Ingestor ETL** is an open source Python-based tool developed by **PAiCore Technologies**. It enables the parsing and ingestion of network trace files (*PCAP/PCAPNG*) for various telecom protocols into a **PostgreSQL** database.

This repository is designed for educational and community-driven collaboration, demonstrating how to handle the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for telecom network data.

## Features

- üöÄ **Protocol Support**: GTP, SIP, CAP, HTTP, SMPP, Diameter, and SS7
- üìÇ **Database Integration**: Scalable PostgreSQL storage
- üîÑ **Modular Architecture**: Extensible and maintainable codebase
- üì° **Telecom Focus**: Specialized handling for Diameter (AAA) and SS7 networks

---

## What‚Äôs Included

- üêç **Python scripts** for parsing Diameter, GTP, SIP, SMPP, HTTP, GSM MAP, and other protocols.
- üóÑÔ∏è Example **PostgreSQL configuration** to store parsed data.
- üìÑ Example `config.py` and `requirements.txt`.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PostgreSQL** (local or remote)
- Recommended OS: **Ubuntu 22.04** or similar

> üí° Ensure PostgreSQL allows remote connections and has proper user permissions

## Install Dependencies

1. Create virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Key Dependencies**:  
`dpkt`, `pycrate`, `smpppdu`, `SQLAlchemy`, `psycopg2`, `xmltodict`

## Database Setup

**Step 1:** Create two databases:
- `nbm` ‚Üí Raw trace storage.
- `ingestion` ‚Üí Parsed and processed data.

**Step 2:** Create a PostgreSQL user with appropriate privileges.

**Example connection (`config.py`):**

```python
class Settings():
    DB_HOSTNAME: str = "127.0.0.1"
    DB_PORT: str = "5432"
    DB_NAME: str = "nbm"
    DB_USERNAME: str = "your_username"
    DB_PASSWORD: str = "your_password"

settings = Settings()
```

## Usage
Run protocol-specific ingestors:

```bash
python diameter.py   # Diameter protocol
# python gtp.py     # GTP protocol
# python sip.py     # SIP protocol
```

> Always verify credentials in `config.py` before execution

## Best Practices

- Use virtual environments for dependency isolation
- Store credentials securely (never hardcode)
- Start with small PCAP samples for testing
- Monitor database performance with large volumes
